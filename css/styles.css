  * Parts of the sides will not be vibile in most cases but the image is not distorted, which I think is a fair trade off
  * Instead of 'cover' I could have used 'stretch', it will stretch/expand the image to fit and in most cases look distored
  * I could have aslo used 'contain', but after testing this shrinks the image to fit but leaves very unappealing border spacing on top and bottom
  * 'cover' was the best choice after testing all three as images are of a high quality so even when cropped they look quite good. (end of James note) */

* We have choosen -lg (large) as it expands at screens width that is greater than or equal to 992px. 
* Along with navbar-light whihc is dark text on a light background - to ensure good contrast so end user can read/see it well.
* We have choosen this layout as we do not want the navbar to collapse and remain fixed
